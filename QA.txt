Island Height Finder - QA Analysis Report
Bugs Encountered and Solutions

Header Offset Bug

    Description: After adding the header, clicks on islands near the header weren't registering correctly
    Detection: When testing island selection near the top of the map
    Solution: Adjusted mouse position calculation to account for header height offset in get_selected_island method


Button Overlap Issue

    Description: Restart and Exit buttons were rendering on top of each other in the game over window
    Detection: Visually noticed in the game over screen
    Solution: Implemented proper spacing and positioning calculations for buttons


Multiple Island Selection

    Description: Players could click the same island multiple times
    Detection: During gameplay testing
    Solution: Implemented island flooding mechanism to turn selected islands into water



Testing Strategy

Input Testing

Test mouse clicks on different areas:

    Edges of islands
    Water areas
    Header area
    Game over window
    Borders between different height levels


Test keyboard inputs (ESC key)
Test window controls (minimize, maximize, close)


Game Logic Testing

    Verify correct height calculation for each island
    Ensure guess counter decrements properly
    Check win/lose conditions trigger correctly
    Verify island flooding mechanism works for all island sizes
    Test restart functionality maintains game state integrity


UI/UX Testing

    Verify legend readability and accuracy
    Check text visibility against backgrounds
    Test button responsiveness
    Verify game over window appears correctly
    Check header layout at different window sizes


Edge Cases

Test with maps containing:

    Single large island
    Multiple small islands
    Islands of equal height
    Islands touching map borders


Test rapid clicking
Test window resizing
Test with different screen resolutions



Potential Improvements

Gameplay Enhancements

    Add difficulty levels (different number of guesses)
    Implement a scoring system based on:

        Number of guesses used
        Speed of completion
        Size of islands correctly identified


    Add hints system:

        Show height of last clicked island
        Highlight islands within certain height ranges
        Hot/cold indicator based on proximity to highest island




Visual Improvements

Add animations:

    Island flooding effect
    Height indicator when hovering over islands
    Transition effects between game states


    Implement dynamic lighting based on height
    Add mini-map showing overall island distribution
    Improve tile textures and visual feedback


Add statistics tracking:

    Win/loss ratio
    Average guesses needed
    Fastest completion times





Scaling Factors and Considerations

Map Size Impact

Larger maps would:

    Increase difficulty in visual scanning
    Require more efficient click detection
    Need adjusted guess count balancing
    Possibly need zoom functionality
    Require performance optimization for rendering




Lives/Guesses Balance

Factors affecting optimal guess count:

    Number of islands on map
    Size distribution of islands
    Height distribution complexity
    Player skill level progression



Performance Considerations

Optimization needed for:

Large maps with many islands
Flooding animation effects
Real-time height calculations
